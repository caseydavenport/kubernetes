# NetworkPolicy

## Abstract

A proposal for implementing a new resource - NetworkPolicy - which
will enable definition of ingress policies for selections of pods.

The design for this proposal has been created by, and discussed
extensively within the Kubernetes networking SIG.  It has been implemented
and tested using Kubernetes API extensions by various networking solutions already.

In this design, users can create various NetworkPolicy objects which select groups of pods and
define how those pods should be allowed to communicate with each other.  The
implementation of that policy at the network layer is left up to the
chosen networking solution.

> Note that this proposal does not yet include egress / cidr-based policy, which is still actively undergoing discussion in the SIG. These are expected to augment this proposal in a backwards compatible way. 

## Implementation

The implmentation in Kubernetes consists of:
- A v1beta NetworkPolicy API object
- A structure on the `Namespace` object to control policy, to be developed as an annotation for now.

### Namespace changes

The following objects will be defined on a Namespace Spec.
>NOTE: In v1beta these objects will be implemented as an annotation.

```go
type IngressIsolationPolicy string

const (
	// Deny all ingress traffic to pods in this namespace.
	DefaultDeny IngressIsolationPolicy = "DefaultDeny"
) 

// Standard NamespaceSpec object, modified to include a new
// NamespaceNetworkPolicy field.
type NamespaceSpec struct {
	// This is a pointer so that it can be left undefined.
	NetworkPolicy *NamespaceNetworkPolicy `json:"networkPolicy,omitempty"`
}

type NamespaceNetworkPolicy struct {
	// Ingress configuration for this namespace.  This config is 
	// applied to all pods within this namespace. For now, only 
	// ingress is supported.  This field is optional - if not 
	// defined, then the cluster default for ingress is applied.
	Ingress *NamespaceIngressPolicy `json:"ingress,omitempty"`
}

// Configuration for ingress to pods within this namespace.
// For now, this only supports specifying an isolation policy.
type NamespaceIngressPolicy struct {
	// The isolation policy to apply to pods in this namespace.
	// Currently this field only supports "DefaultDeny", but could 
	// be extended to support other policies in the future.  When set to DefaultDeny,
	// pods in this namespace are denied ingress traffic.  When not defined,
	// the cluster default ingress policy is applied (currently allow all). 
	Isolation *IngressIsolationPolicy `json:"isolation,omitempty"` 
}
```

```yaml
kind: Namespace
apiVersion: v1
spec:
  networkPolicy:
    ingress:
      isolation: DefaultDeny
```

The above structures will be represented in v1beta as a json encoded annotation like so:
```
kind: Namespace
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  annotations:
    net.beta.kubernetes.io/networkPolicy: "{\"ingress\": {\"isolation\": \"DefaultDeny\"}}" 
```

### NetworkPolicy Go Definition 

Once a Namespace is isolated, a mechanism to selectively allow traffic into the namespace and between pods within
the namespace is required.  That is accomplished through ingress rules on `NetworkPolicy`
objects (of which there can be multiple in a single namespace).  Pods selected by
one or more NetworkPolicy objects should allow any incoming connections that match any
ingress rule on those NetworkPolicy objects, per the network pluginâ€™s capabilities.

If `isolation` is not specified on a namespace, then all traffic is allowed to pods in that namespace. 

```go
type NetworkPolicy struct {
  TypeMeta
  ObjectMeta

  // Specification of the desired behavior for this NetworkPolicy.
  Spec NetworkPolicySpec 
}

type NetworkPolicySpec struct {
  // Selects the pods to which this NetworkPolicy object
  // applies.  The array of NetworkPolicyIngressRules below 
  // is applied to any pods selected by this field.
  // Multiple NetworkPolicy objects can select the same set of pods.  In this case,
  // the NetworkPolicyRules for each are combined additively.
  PodSelector *unversioned.LabelSelector `json:"podSelector,omitempty"`

  // List of ingress rules to be applied to the selected pods.
  // Traffic is allowed to a pod if Namespace.NetworkPolicy.Ingress.Isolation is undefined, 
  // OR if the traffic source is the pod's host (for kubelet health checks), 
  // OR if Namespace.NetworkPolicy.Ingress.Isolation=DefaultDeny and the traffic matches at least 
  // one NetworkPolicyIngressRule across all of the NetworkPolicy 
  // objects whose podSelector matches the pod.  If this field is 
  // empty, this NetworkPolicy has no effect on selected pods.
  Ingress []NetworkPolicyIngressRule `json:"ingress,omitempty"`
}

type NetworkPolicyIngressRule struct {
  // List of ports which should be made accessible on the pods selected by PodSelector.  
  // Each item in this list is combined using a logical OR.  If this field
  // is empty, then traffic should not be restricted based on port.  If this 
  // field is not empty, traffic must match at least one NetworkPolicyPort in the list
  // or else it will be dropped.
  Ports []NetworkPolicyPort `json:"ports,omitempty"`

  // List of sources which should be able to access the pods selected by PodSelector.
  // Items in this list are combined using a logical OR operation.
  // If this field is empty, then traffic should not be restricted based on 
  // source.  If this field is not empty, traffic must match at least one 
  // NetworkPolicySource in the list or else it will be dropped.
  From []NetworkPolicySource `json:"from,omitempty"`
}

type NetworkPolicyPort struct {
  // The protocol (TCP or UDP) which traffic must match.
  // If not defined, this field defaults to TCP. 
  Protocol api.Protocol `json:"protocol"`

  // If specified, the port on the given protocol.  This can 
  // either be a numerical or named port.  If not defined,
  // this NetworkPolicyPort does not restrict based on port number.
  // If defined, only traffic on the specified protocol AND port
  // will be matched by this NetworkPolicyPort.
  Port *intstr.IntOrString `json:"port,omitempty"`
}

type NetworkPolicySource struct {
  // If 'Namespaces' is defined, 'Pods' must not be.
  // This is a label selector which selects Pods in this namespace.
  // This NetworkPolicySource matches any pods selected by this selector.
  Pods *unversioned.LabelSelector `json:"pods,omitempty"`

  // If 'Pods' is defined, 'Namespaces' must not be.
  // Selects Kubernetes Namespaces.  This NetworkPolicySource matches 
  // all pods in all namespaces selected by this label selector. 
  Namespaces *unversioned.LabelSelector `json:"namespaces,omitempty"`
}
```

### Behavior

The following pseudo-code attempts to define when traffic is allowed to a given pod when using this API.

```python
def is_traffic_allowed(traffic, pod):
  """
  Returns True if traffic is allowed to this pod, False otherwise.
  """
  if not namespace.networkPolicy.ingress.isolation:
    # If ingress isolation is disabled on the Namespace, all traffic is allowed.
    return True 
  elif traffic.source == pod.node:
    # Traffic is from the pod's host - this allows for kubelet health checks.
    return True
  else:
    # If namespace ingress isolation is enabled, only allow traffic 
    # that matches a network policy which selects this pod.
    for network_policy in network_policies(pod.namespace):
      if not network_policy.podSelector.selects(pod):
        # This policy doesn't select this pod. Try the next one. 
        continue

      # This policy selects this pod.  Check each ingress rule 
      # defined on this policy to see if it allows the traffic.
      for ingress_rule in network_policy.ingress:
        if ingress_rule.from.matches(traffic) and \
             ingress_rule.ports.matches(traffic):
          return True 

  # Ingress isolation is DefaultDeny and no policies match the given pod and traffic.
  return False
```

### Open Questions

- A single podSelector per NetworkPolicy may lead to managing a large number of NetworkPolicy objects, each of which is small and easy to understand on its own.  Allowing a podSelecor per ingress rule would allow for fewer, larger NetworkPolicy objects that may be easier to manage, but harder to understand individually.  This proposal has opted to favor a larger number of smaller objects that are easier to understand.  Is this the right decision? 

- Is the `Namespaces` selector in the `NetworkPolicySource` struct too coarse? Do we need to support the AND combination of `Namespaces` and `Pods`? 

### Examples

1) Only allow traffic from frontend pods on TCP port 6379 to backend pods in the same namespace.

```yaml
kind: Namespace
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: myns
  annotations:
    net.beta.kubernetes.io/networkPolicy: "{\"ingress\": {\"isolation\": \"DefaultDeny\"}"
---
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: v1beta 
metadata:
  name: allow-frontend
  namespace: myns
spec:
  podSelector:            
    role: backend
  ingress:                
    - from:              
        - pods:
            role: frontend
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 6379
```

2) Allow TCP 443 from any source in Bob's namespaces. 

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: v1beta 
metadata:
  name: allow-tcp-443
spec:
  podSelector:            
    role: frontend 
  ingress:
    - ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 443 
      from:
        - namespaces:
            user: bob 
```

3) Allow all traffic to all pods in this namespace.

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: v1beta 
metadata:
  name: allow-all
spec:
  podSelector:            
  ingress:
    - {}
```
