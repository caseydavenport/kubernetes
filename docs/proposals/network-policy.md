# NetworkPolicy

## Abstract

A proposal for implementing a new resource - NetworkPolicy - which
will enable definition of ingress policies for selections of pods.

The design for this proposal has been created by, and discussed
extensively within the Kubernetes networking SIG.  It has been implemented
and tested using Kubernetes API extensions by various networking solutions already.

In this design, users can create various NetworkPolicy objects which select groups of pods and
define how those pods should be allowed to communicate with each other.  The
implementation of that policy at the network layer is left up to the
chosen networking solution.

> Note that this proposal does not yet include egress / cidr-based policy, which is still actively undergoing discussion in the SIG.  In general,
egress is expected to augment this proposal rather than modify it, with one exception (noted below).

## Implementation

The implmentation in Kubernetes consists of:
- A v1beta NetworkPolicy API object
- A field on the `Namespace` object to control isolation.

### Namespace changes

> Note that this section is subject to some change with the addition of egress policy as mentioned above.

The `Namespace` object will be augmented with the field `networkIsolation` which will take one of the following values:

When `networkIsolation=yes` is set on a namespace:
- Pods in that Namespace will not be accessible from any other source, unless explicitly allowed by a NetworkPolicy object.
- Pods in that Namespace will be able to access any other source (egress is uninhibited).

When `networkIsolation=no` is set on a namespace:
- Pods in that Namespace will be accessible from any other source.
- Pods in that Namespace will be able to access any other source.

The `networkIsolation` field will default to `false` if not specified.

### NetworkPolicy YAML Definition and Behavior

Once the namespace is isolated, a mechanism to selectively allow traffic into the namespace and between pods within
the namespace is required.  That is accomplished through ingress rules on `NetworkPolicy`
objects (of which there can be multiple in a single namespace).  Pods selected by
a NetworkPolicy should allow any incoming connections that match any
ingress rule, per the network pluginâ€™s capabilities.

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: v1beta 
metadata:
  name:
  namespace:
spec:
  podSelector:            // Standard label selector - selects pods.  
  ingress:                // List of ingress rules (optional).             
    - ports:              // List of allowed ports / protocols (optional).          
        - port:           // Port on the specified protocol (optional). 
          protocol:       // Protocol (TCP, UDP) 
      from:               // List of allowed sources (optional).    
        - pods:           // Label selector - selects Pods (optional). 
          namespaces:     // Label selector - selects Namespaces (optional).
```

Each NetworkPolicy object supports the following fields:
- `podSelector`: A label selector which selects which pods this `NetworkPolicy` applies to.
- `ingress`: A list of ingress rules.  If not present, this `NetworkPolicy` has no effect on ingress to the selected pods.

Each ingress rule supports the following fields:
- `ports`: A list of protocol / ports which should be accessible on the selected pods. If not defined, then access to the selected pods will not be restricted by port/protocol.
- `from`: A list of source criteria which dictate which sources should be able to access the pods selected. If no `from` key is provided, then access will not be restricted based on source.

Each item in the `ports` list supports the following fields:
- `protocol`: The protocol for the given port - TCP or UDP.
- `port`: The port on the specified protocol.

Each item in the `from` list may declare at most one of the following:
- `pods`: A label selector which selects pods (in the same namespace as the NetworkPolicy).
- `namespaces`: A label selector which selects namespaces.

Note:
- Any traffic which does not match one of the NetworkPolicy ingress rules will be dropped via a default
drop behavior (this occurs whether or not network-isolation has been enabled on the Namespace).
- All ingress rules are whitelist rules, meaning that it should be easy to resolve the case where multiple
NetworkPolicy objects select the same set of pods, as there can be no conflicting rules.
- All pods will always be accessible from the host that they are running on.  This is required to allow for kubelet health checks.
