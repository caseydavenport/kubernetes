# NetworkPolicy

## Abstract

A proposal for implementing a new resource - NetworkPolicy - which
will enable definition of ingress policies for selections of pods.

The design for this proposal has been created by, and discussed
extensively within the Kubernetes networking SIG.  It has been implemented
and tested using Kubernetes API extensions by various networking solutions already.

In this design, users can create various NetworkPolicy objects which select groups of pods and
define how those pods should be allowed to communicate with each other.  The
implementation of that policy at the network layer is left up to the
chosen networking solution.

> Note that this proposal does not yet include egress / cidr-based policy, which is still actively undergoing discussion in the SIG.  In general,
egress is expected to augment this proposal rather than modify it, with one exception (noted below).

## Implementation

The implmentation in Kubernetes consists of:
- A v1beta NetworkPolicy API object
- A field on the `Namespace` object to control isolation, to be developed as an annotation for now, called `net.beta.kubernetes.io/network-isolation`.

### Namespace changes

> Note that this section is subject to some change with the addition of egress policy as mentioned above.

The `Namespace` object can be augmented with the annotation `net.beta.kubernetes.io/network-isolation` which will take one of the following values:

When `net.beta.kubernetes.io/network-isolation=true` is set on a namespace:
- Pods in that Namespace will not be accessible from any other source, even sources within that namespace, unless explicitly allowed by a NetworkPolicy object.
- Pods in that Namespace will be able to access any other destination.

When `net.beta.kubernetes.io/network-isolation=false` is set on a namespace:
- Pods in that Namespace will be accessible from any other source.
- Pods in that Namespace will be able to access any other destination.

This field will default to `false` if not specified.

### NetworkPolicy Go Definition

Once the namespace is isolated, a mechanism to selectively allow traffic into the namespace and between pods within
the namespace is required.  That is accomplished through ingress rules on `NetworkPolicy`
objects (of which there can be multiple in a single namespace).  Pods selected by
one or more NetworkPolicy objects should allow any incoming connections that match any
ingress rule on those NetworkPolicy objects, per the network pluginâ€™s capabilities.

If `net.beta.kubernetes.io/network-isolation=false` on a namespace, then all traffic is allowed to / from pods in that namespace whether or not any NetworkPolicy objects have been created in that namespace.

```go
type NetworkPolicy struct {
  TypeMeta
  ObjectMeta

  // Specification of the desired behavior for this NetworkPolicy.
  Spec NetworkPolicySpec 
}

type NetworkPolicySpec struct {
  // Selects the pods to which this NetworkPolicy object
  // applies.  The array of NetworkPolicyIngressRules below 
  // is applied to any pods selected by this field.
  // Multiple NetworkPolicy objects can select the same set of pods.  In this case,
  // the NetworkPolicyRules for each are combined additively.
  PodSelector *unversioned.LabelSelector `json:"podSelector,omitempty"`

  // List of ingress rules to be applied to the selected pods.
  // Traffic is allowed to a pod if network-isolation=false, 
  // if the traffic source is the pod's host (for kubelet health checks), 
  // or if network-isolation=true and the traffic matches at least 
  // one NetworkPolicyIngressRule across all of the NetworkPolicy 
  // objects whose podSelector matches the pod.  If this field is 
  // empty, this NetworkPolicy has no effect on selected pods.
  Ingress []NetworkPolicyIngressRule `json:"ingress,omitempty"`

type NetworkPolicyIngressRule struct {
  // List of ports which should be made accessible on the pods selected by PodSelector.  
  // Each item in this list is combined using a logical OR.  If this field
  // is empty, then traffic should not be restricted based on port.  If this 
  // field is not empty, traffic must match at least one NetworkPolicyPort in the list
  // or else it will be dropped.
  Ports []NetworkPolicyPort `json:"ports,omitempty"`

  // List of sources which should be able to access the pods selected by PodSelector.
  // Items in this list are combined using a logical OR operation.
  // If this field is empty, then traffic should not be restricted based on 
  // source.  If this field is not empty, traffic must match at least one 
  // NetworkPolicySource in the list or else it will be dropped.
  From []NetworkPolicySource `json:"from,omitempty"`
}

type NetworkPolicyPort struct {
  // The protocol (TCP or UDP) which traffic must match.
  // If not defined, this field defaults to TCP. 
  Protocol api.Protocol `json:"protocol"`

  // If specified, the port on the given protocol.  This can 
  // either be a numerical or named port.  If not defined,
  // this NetworkPolicyPort does not restrict based on port number.
  // If defined, only traffic on the specified protocol AND port
  // will be matched by this NetworkPolicyPort.
  Port IntOrString `json:"port,omitempty"`
}

type NetworkPolicySource struct {
  // If 'Namespaces' is defined, 'Pods' must not be.
  // This is a label selector which selects Pods in this namespace.
  // This NetworkPolicySource matches any pods selected by this selector.
  Pods *unversioned.LabelSelector `json:"pods,omitempty"`

  // If 'Pods' is defined, 'Namespces' must not be.
  // Selects Kubernetes Namespaces.  This NetworkPolicySource matches 
  // all pods in all namespaces selected by this label selector. 
  Namespaces *unversioned.LabelSelector `json:"namespaces,omitempty"`
}
```

### Behavior

The following pseudo-code attempts to define when traffic is allowed to a given pod when using this API.

```python
def is_traffic_allowed(traffic, pod):
  """
  Returns True if traffic is allowed to this pod, False otherwise.
  """
  if namespace.network_isolation == False:
    # If network-isolation is disabled, all traffic is allowed.
    return True 
  elif traffic.source == pod.node:
    # Traffic is from the pod's host - this allows for kubelet health checks.
    return True
  else:
    # If network-isolation is enabled, only allow traffic 
    # that matches a network policy which selects this pod.
    for network_policy in network_policies(pod.namespace):
      if not network_policy.podSelector.selects(pod):
        # This policy doesn't select this pod. Try the next one. 
        continue

      # This policy selects this pod.  Check each ingress rule 
      # defined on this policy to see if it allows the traffic.
      for ingress_rule in network_policy.ingress:
        if ingress_rule.from.matches(traffic) and \
             ingress_rule.ports.matches(traffic):
          return True 

  # network-isolation is True and no policies match the given pod and traffic.
  return False
```

### Open Questions

> The question then remains whether one NP object per "app" makes sense (in this case app={a,b,c}) or whether one NP object per selector

- A single podSelector per NetworkPolicy may lead to managing a large number of NetworkPolicy objects, each of which is small and easy to understand on its own.  Allowing a podSelecor per ingress rule would allow for fewer, larger NetworkPolicy objects that may be easier to manage, but harder to understand individually.  This proposal has opted to favor a larger number of smaller objects that are easier to understand.  Is this the right decision?

- Is the `Namespaces` selector in the `NetworkPolicySource` struct too coarse? Do we need to support the AND combination of `Namespaces` and `Pods`?

### Examples

1) Only allow traffic from frontend pods on TCP port 6379 to backend pods in the same namespace.

```yaml
kind: Namespace
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: myns
  annotations:
    net.beta.kubernetes.io/network-isolation=true
---
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: v1beta 
metadata:
  name: allow-frontend
  namespace: myns
spec:
  podSelector:            
    role: backend
  ingress:                
    - from:              
        - pods:
            role: frontend
      ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 6379
```

2) Allow TCP 443 from any source in Bob's namespaces.

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: v1beta 
metadata:
  name: allow-tcp-443
spec:
  podSelector:            
    role: frontend 
  ingress:
    - ports:
        - protocol: TCP
          port: 443 
      from:
        - namespaces:
            user: bob 
```

3) Allow all traffic to all pods in this namespace.

```yaml
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: v1beta 
metadata:
  name: allow-all
spec:
  podSelector:            
  ingress:
    - {}
```
